Graphics Gems

   The file src/libvfplot/cubic.c contains code derived from that in the
   Graphics Gems collection. The latter comes with the following mellow
   licence


     EULA: The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words,
     you cannot claim the text of the code as your own and resell it. Using
     the code is permitted in any program, product, or library,
     non-commercial or commercial. Giving credit is not required, though is
     a nice gesture. The code comes as-is, and if there are any flaws or
     problems with any Gems code, nobody involved with Gems - authors,
     editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to be held responsible.
     Basically, don't be a jerk, and remember that anything free comes with
     no guarantee.
