<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The dom file format is used by the 
<citerefentry>
<refentrytitle>vfplot</refentrytitle>
<manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
</citerefentry>
program for representing the boundary of a vector field.
</para>

<para>The format is plain ASCII and consists of a number of paths 
concatenated. A path is a header line, a hash (#) and optional 
ignored text, followed by at least one point line. A point line 
consists of a pair of floating point numbers separated by 
whitespace.</para> 

<para>All path are closed but the last point of a path need
not (should not) be the same as the first, the final segment
is implicit. A path is interpreted as the boundary to a
(possibly infinite) domain which lies to its right; so the
order of the points is significant.</para> 

<para>A path should not intersect itself, nor any other
path. A path may be entirely contained within another path, 
for example for a domain with a hole. In this case the 
contained path should occur in the file after the containing
path (this restriction may be removed at a later date).</para>
