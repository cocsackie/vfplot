  <title>Graphics Gems</title>

  <para>
  The file <filename>src/libvfplot/cubic.c</filename>
  contains code derived from that in the Graphics Gems collection. 
  The latter comes with the following mellow licence
  </para>

  <blockquote>
  <attribution>Graphics Gems Licence</attribution>
  <para>
  EULA:	The Graphics Gems code is copyright-protected. In other words, you cannot 
  claim the text of the code as your own and resell it. Using the code is permitted 
  in any program, product, or library, non-commercial or commercial. Giving credit 
  is not required, though is a nice gesture. The code comes as-is, and if there 
  are any flaws or problems with any Gems code, nobody involved with Gems - authors, 
  editors, publishers, or webmasters - are to be held responsible. Basically, don't 
  be a jerk, and remember that anything free comes with no guarantee.
