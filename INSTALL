        Windows XP with Cygwin

Executive summary

   Building vfplot is quite standard: the usual

    ./configure
    make
    su
    make install

   Use the --prefix option to ./configure if you want to install elsewhere
   than /usr/local.

   See ./configure --help for a full list of configuration options.

Optional features

   If the NetCDF library is found then vfplot will be able to read GMT grd
   files.

   If the matio library is found then vfplot will be able to read mat
   (Matlab binary) files.

   If you want support for Gerris flow solver files use the
   --enable-gerris option in configuration. You will need to have a recent
   version of the Gerris software.

   If the pthread (POSIX thread) library is found then vfplot will support
   multithreaded force calculations giving a substantial speedup on
   multiprocessor hardware.

   If the zlib library is found then the graphics state files will be
   compressed with gzip (see the --graphic-state option).

Platform specific notes

   The program should compile on any modern POSIX operating system with a
   C99 compiler. It is developed on Linux on the x86, AMD64 and Sparc
   architectures with the GNU C compiler.

Windows XP with Cygwin

   The program is tested on Windows XP with the Cygwin POSIX compatibility
   layer.

   To build, first use the Cygwin startup.exe program to install the gcc,
   make and zlib pacakges. Then obtain, compile and install the netcdf and
   libmatio libraries listed above. Finally, configure with
   --disable-pthread then make and install as usual.
