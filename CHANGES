1.0.13

     * Fixed a bug in the numerical calculation of the field radius of
       curvature used in the dynamic.
     * The sag2grd utility rewritten in Python.

1.0.12

     * Short-circuit when the Perram-Werthiem distance is found to be
       greater than one (the ellipses do not intersect) giving a 20%
       speedup.
     * Updated to the latest version of John Tsiombikas's kdtree library.

1.0.11

     * Simplification of the threading code.

1.0.10

     * Rewrote the POSIX threading for the force calculation, resulting in
       a substantial speedup on multiprocessor hardware: A plot taking 10
       seconds with -j1 will now typically take 6.5 seconds with -j2 on a
       dual-processor machine.
       The default behaviour is now to use as many threads as there are
       CPUs on the system, if this number can be determined. Otherwise one
       thread is used.
     * Updated the gfs2xyz2D program to compile against the most recent
       version of Gerris following the removal of some obsolete API
       features in January 2012.

1.0.9

     * Fixed a domain generation bug (strange winding number)
     * Modified the sag2grid program to handle input files with leading
       and trailing whitespace
       Fixed Makefile for sag2grid so that it is now actually installed.

1.0.8

     * Simplified the bilinear grid code and modified the radius of
       curvature calculation therein to use one-sided derivatives if the
       two-sided devivatives cannot be used due to lack of data.
       The result is that curvature data is usually available right up to
       edge of the boundary, improving robustness.
     * The triangle glyph is now the default glyph.

1.0.7

     * Fix for incorrect order of output grd files in sag2grd
     * Fixed a buffer overrun

1.0.6

     * Minor bugfixes found during the Windows/Cygwin port.

1.0.5

     * Output to POV-Ray with --output-format povray.

1.0.4

     * Added a --graphic-state option to cache the results of long program
       runs for final adjustment of line widths, fill colour, glyph type
       and so on.
     * Reading of Matlab binary files.

1.0.3

     * Added a --ke-drop option which delays termination until the kinetic
       energy has dropped by the specified dB.
     * Simplified the potential used in the dynamic â€” removal of the
       attractive tail allows us to reduce the number of neighbours and so
       speed up the dynamic by around a factor of two.
     * Added a perl script sag2grd which converts a sag(5) file to grd
       files.
     * Added a --sag option to the gfs2xyz2D program causing it to write a
       sag(5) header to the output data.
     * Fixed floating point exception bug in dim2.c
     * Fixed a fencepost error in dim2.c which caused a leak in the
       boundary during the dynamic.
     * The default value for the --threads option is now 1 rather than the
       number of CPUs. Use a value of 0 to restore the autodetection.
     * Removed thread creation/destruction and attendant overhead when the
       processing is single-threaded.
     * Removed signal handler for SIGFPE since, according to POSIX,
       ignoring it results in undefined behaviour.
     * Several fixes in the autoconf handling of sincos(), alloca() etc
       for the FreeBSD port.

1.0.2

     * Added a --glyph option for alternative glyphs. New wedge and
       triangle glyphs.
     * Added a --aspect option to adjust the aspect (the ratio of length
       to width) of the glyph.

1.0.1

     * Corrected sag(5) documentation
     * Reduced the verbosity of some warnings

1.0.0

     * Read and write support for the sag(5) format
     * Implemented autodetection of input files formats (using file magic)
     * Added -L option for late decimation and --decimate-contact for
       finer control the decimation
