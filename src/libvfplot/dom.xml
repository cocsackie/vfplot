<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The dom file format is used by the
<citerefentry>
<refentrytitle>vfplot</refentrytitle>
<manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
</citerefentry>
program for representing the boundary of a vector field.
</para>

<para>The format is plain ASCII and consists of a number of paths
concatenated. A path is a header line, a hash (#) and optional
ignored text, followed by at least one point line. A point line
consists of a pair of floating point numbers separated by
whitespace.</para>

<para>All path are closed but the last point of a path need
not (should not) be the same as the first, the final segment
is implicit. </para>

<para>A path should not intersect itself, nor any other
path. A path may be entirely contained within another path,
for example for a domain with a hole. In this case the
contained path should occur in the file after the containing
path (this restriction may be removed at a later date).
The outermost path is interpreted as the boundary of a finite
domain (a domain must be finite in extent), a path inside that
is the boundary of a hole, a boundary inside that is a boundary
of an island domain in the hole and so on.  The orientation
of the points (clockwise or anticlockwise) is irrelevant, in
contrast to many other vector formats.</para>
